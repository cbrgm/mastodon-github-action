## Inputs

- `url`: **Required** - Mastodon instance URL.
- `access-token`: **Required** - Mastodon access token for authentication. Use secrets to protect your access token.
- `message`: **Required** - The content of the toot to be posted.
- `visibility`: Optional - Visibility of the toot (`public`, `unlisted`, `private`, `direct`). Defaults to `public`.
- `sensitive`: Optional - Mark the toot and attached media as sensitive. Accepts `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`.
- `spoiler-text`: Optional - Text to be shown as a warning before the actual content, used when `sensitive` is `true`.
- `language`: Optional - ISO 639 language code for the toot, helping to categorize the post by language.
- `scheduled-at`: Optional - ISO 8601 Datetime when the toot should be posted. Must be at least 5 minutes in the future.

## Outputs

- `id`: The ID of the toot that was posted. Useful for further actions or logging.
- `url`: The URL to the toot if present. Allows direct access to the posted toot.
- `scheduled_at`: The datetime at which the toot is scheduled to be posted, in ISO 8601 format if the toot was scheduled for a future time.

## Container Usage

This action can be executed independently from workflows within a container. To do so, use the following command:

```
podman run --rm -it ghcr.io/cbrgm/mastodon-github-action:v2 --help
```

## Workflow Usage

First, open `/settings/applications/new` of your instance on your browser and create new application. Once the application is created set the following repository secrets

* `MASTODON_URL` - Your instance URL, e.g. `https://example.social`
* `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Your access token obtained from your newly created application

Use the following step in your GitHub Actions Workflow:

```yaml

- name: Send toot to Mastodon
  id: mastodon
  uses: cbrgm/mastodon-github-action@v2
  with:
    access-token: ${{ secrets.MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN }} # access token
    url: ${{ secrets.MASTODON_URL }} # https://example.social
    message: "Hello from GitHub Actions!"

```

Advanced usage:

```yaml
- name: Send toot to Mastodon with additional options
  id: mastodon_toot
  uses: cbrgm/mastodon-github-action@v2
  with:
    access-token: ${{ secrets.MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN }} # Mastodon access token for authentication.
    url: ${{ secrets.MASTODON_URL }} # Mastodon instance URL, e.g., https://example.social.
    message: "Hello from GitHub Actions! Check out our latest update." # The content of the toot.
    visibility: "unlisted" # Make the toot unlisted to avoid spamming public timelines.
    sensitive: "true" # Mark the toot as sensitive.
    spoiler-text: "Latest Update" # Provide a content warning for the actual message.
    language: "en" # ISO 639 language code for the toot.
    scheduled-at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" # Schedule the toot for a future date/time.

# Example on how to use outputs from the Mastodon action step.
- name: Get toot information
  run: |
    echo "Toot ID: ${{ steps.mastodon_toot.outputs.id }}"
    echo "Toot URL: ${{ steps.mastodon_toot.outputs.url }}"
    echo "Scheduled at: ${{ steps.mastodon_toot.outputs.scheduled_at }}"
```
